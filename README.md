Handwritten Digit Recognizer GUI using Python and Neural Networks

One of the most practical difficulties in pattern recognition applications is handwritten digit recognition. 
Digit recognition is used in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, and other applications. 
The capacity to design an efficient algorithm that can recognize handwritten digits and which is submitted by users via scanner, tablet, and other digital devices is at the heart of the problem. 
Handwritten digit recognition is already widely employed in the automated processing of bank checks, postal addresses, and other types of information. 
Some of the existing systems use computational intelligence techniques like artificial neural networks or fuzzy logic, while others may simply be massive lookup databases containing possible handwritten digit recognition. 
Since the 1940s, artificial neural networks have been constructed. We aim to complete this by using CNN and MNIST data set.
